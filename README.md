This is a simple voice recorder for Firefox OS. Just tap to start
recording, tap again to stop.

Every minute of recording is written to a new file in the folder
`recorder/`. The resulting `.oga` files must be concatenated manually
to reconstruct the full recording.

It keeps recording in the background, even with screen locked. Don't
forget to stop it!
